This repository holds all the necessary data and scripts to reproduce our analyses
of populations of coho salmon and steelhead trout in California that were sampled
several generations in time apart.

## Code

There are some R functions common to the analyses of both species.  These 
are in `./R/ccc-sonc-functions.R`.  

The R script that accomplish the analyses are in the directories:

- `./R-main/coho` for the coho
- `./R-main/steelhead` for the steelhead

All the data are in the `./data` directory.



## Slurping the Colony Results

For extending this study using whole genome sequencing, we want to pick samples
that might not be full siblings of one another from each sample.  So I post-process
the Colony results using `./201-colony-summarize.Rmd`.

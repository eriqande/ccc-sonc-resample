This repository holds all the necessary data and scripts to reproduce our analyses of populations of coho salmon and steelhead trout in California that were sampled several generations in time apart.

Code
----

There are some R functions common to the analyses of both species. These are in `./R/ccc-sonc-functions.R`.

The R script that accomplish the analyses are in the directories:

-   `./R-main/coho` for the coho
-   `./R-main/steelhead` for the steelhead

All the data are in the `./data` directory.
